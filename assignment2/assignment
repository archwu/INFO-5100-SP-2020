1) Write a method to take a String and character as input and find how many characters are in the String
	Example #1
		Input : "North", 'r'
		Output : "North" has 1 'r'

2) Write a method to find the maximum and minimum number in an array of numbers
	Example:
		Input : [3, 5, 7, 1, 4, 32, 15]
		Output : Max is 32 and Min is 1

3) Write a java function that adds all the digits of an integer until it is single digit.
		i. function takes an integer as input and returns its sum of digits.
		ii. for example input = 37, sum = 3+7 = 10, sum = 1+0 = 1. result = 1.

		Here is the prototype you can work with

		public int addDigits (int input){
		}
